## Introduction[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#introduction)

**[NxT Learn](https://sulu.io/)** is an open source E-Learning platform that relies on the learner guided education philosophy. NxT learn focuses on overcoming the traditional learning strategies such as exams at the end of the module but rather offers learners skill-based projects during the module and after the module.

Have a look at the official [NxT Learn](nxt-learn.vercel.app) for a comprehensive list of Sulu's features, core values and use cases.

If you want to join the NxT learn as a learner or an instructor you can join us **[here.](nxt-learn.vercel.app)**. If you want to help us maintain the core architecture of the NxT learn project you can also join us **[here](https://github.com/MokuaEnock/NxT-learn)** for a complete step-by-step guide on how you can develop with us.

## Motivation[![](./docs/img/pin.svg)](#motivation)

Traditional avenues for education are resource intensive and have been criticized for a long time for not allowing room for differently-abled learners to explore their options, this has led to education rewarding individuals who are good at cramming and not necessarily at problem-solving. The crammers after completing their education and being released into the world are faced with very different problems that do not require cramming.

The NxT learn was implemented to overcome these challenges it seeks to change the avenues of education by implementing the following.

1. **Project-based** - Learners doing real world projects throughout the course and after the course.

2. **Learner-centered** - Learning is student-centered and learners solve challenges within themselves and only have access to the instructor when they face a blocker. The instructor only guides the learner through motivation and rewards.
